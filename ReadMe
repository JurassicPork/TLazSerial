 Fixes for OS-X (thanks to rphoover), SynSer(synaser) properties now persistent, v0.3 of GPS simulator
 On OS-X you must set the property  SynSer/NonBlock to True  in the properties of TLazserial component. 
 
Features :
Changed :  baudrate values.
           stop bits  new value : 1.5
new event : onstatus
new property FRcvLineCRLF : if this property is true, you use RecvString
in place of RecvPacket when you read data from the port.

new procedure  ShowSetupDialog to open a port settings form :
the device combobox contain the enumerated ports.
new procedure to enumerate real serial port on linux ( in synaser).

Demo : a simulator of serial port gps + serial port receiver :
you can send NMEA frames ( GGA GLL RMC) to the opened serial port
(start gps simulator). You can change speed and heading.
In the memo you can see what is received from  the opened serial port.
In the status bar you can see the status events.

tested with windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04  Lazarus 2.0.10
                                       
if you haven't serial ports in your PC you can use virtual ports :
1 - WINDOWS 
To simulate  a paired serial ports on  windows : com0com   
ex : 

2 - Linux
To simulate  a paired serial ports on linux : socat 
ex :  socat -d -d PTY: PTY:

To connect to a bluetooth GPS on Linux
echo connection to a  bluetooth GPS(/dev/rfcomm0)

sudo rfcomm bind  0 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx 1
